This is a list of things that would be nice to have.
Help is welcome!

- Set parameters like NLS_DATE_FORMAT *after* the Oracle connection has been
  established.  Otherwise, an ill-guided Oracle logon trigger could mess up
  our NLS settings.

- Convert OCI prefetching to bulk fetches to improve performance for LOBs.

- Add a sample Docker file to build a container with PostgreSQL and oracle_fdw.
  This can also serve as a cookbook for installing the software.

- Aggregate pushdown.
